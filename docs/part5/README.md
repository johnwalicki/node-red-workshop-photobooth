# Summary

That's all folks. If you've reached this point of the workshop, you've covered
a lot of ground. Whether you were already familiar with Node-RED, TensorFlow,
or if it was all new to you, we hope you've found it interesting.

The goal for this workshop was to show how you can quickly start building
applications using low-coding tools. Whilst the application we've
built today is a bit of fun, it shows how much you can achieve with very little code
being written.

It has also shown how you can take Node-RED beyond creating disposable applications
you develop and run on a local device.

The Projects feature gives you proper version control in your low-code developement
environment. Wrapping your application in a container has given you a way to deploy
a production-ready version.

You're a few small steps away from having a GitHub Action (or any other CI/CD tool)
that can automatically rebuild your container with every commit and deploy it out
to your target environment.


## Next Steps

Where you go next is very much up to you.

If you're new to Node-RED, you can explore the [Flow Library](https://flows.nodered.org){:target="blank"}
to see what other nodes are available and what example flows the community have shared

If you're new to TensorFlow, you can explore the other TensorFlow nodes we mentioned and some of the
other prebuilt models that are available. You could explore building your own model and getting that
integrated into your Node-RED application.
