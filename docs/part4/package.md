# Update `package.json`

## Adding dependencies

Through the workshop you've installed a number of additional modules into
Node-RED. We need to make sure they are listed in the project's `package.json`
file so they will get installed into the container.

1. Open the Project Settings dialog from the main menu in the editor (`Projects -> Project Settings`)
2. Switch to the Dependencies tab. You will see a list of the additional modules
   that are *used by the project*. Click the 'add to project' next to each one
   and then close the dialog.

That will have updated the `package.json` file for you. However, for this
scenario there's one more dependency we need to add manually - `node-red`
itself.

The `package.json` file can be found in `~/.node-red/projects/<name-of-project>/package.json`. Open that file in a text editor and make the following changes:

1. add `node-red` to the dependencies section - this will ensure Node-RED gets installed when the container is
built.

         "dependencies": {
             "node-red": "1.x",
             ...
         },

2. Add a `scripts` section to define a `start` command - this is how the
container will run Node-RED:

        "scripts": {
            "start": "node --max-old-space-size=256 ./node_modules/node-red/red.js --userDir . --settings ./settings.js flows.json"
        }

    Let's take a closer look at the start command:

            node
                 --max-old-space-size=256         (a)
                 ./node_modules/node-red/red.js   (b)
                 --userDir .                      (c)
                 --settings ./settings.js         (d)
                 flows.json                        (e)


    1. This argument is used to tell node when it should start garbage collecting.
    2. With `node-red` listed as an npm dependency of the project, we know exactly where it will get installed and where the `red.js` main entry point is.
    3. We want Node-RED to use the current directory as its user directory
    4. Just to be sure, we point at the settings file it should use - something weâ€™ll add in the next step
    5. Finally we specify the flow file to use. If you picked a different flow file name at the start, make sure you use the right name here.

3. Having made those changes, restart Node-RED and reload the editor in your browser.


Your complete `package.json` file should look something like this:

```
{
  "name": "photobooth-workshop",
  "description": "A Node-RED Project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "node-red": "1.x",
    "node-red-contrib-tfjs-coco-ssd": "0.5.2",
    "node-red-dashboard": "2.23.5",
    "node-red-node-annotate-image": "0.1.0",
    "node-red-node-ui-table": "0.3.7",
    "node-red-node-ui-webcam": "0.2.1"
  },
  "node-red": {
    "settings": {
      "flowFile": "flows.json",
      "credentialsFile": "flows_cred.json"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --max-old-space-size=256 ./node_modules/node-red/red.js --userDir . --settings ./settings.js flows.json"
  }
}
```


## Next Steps

With the `package.js` file updated, the next task is to [add a `settings.js` file](settings.md).
