# Node-RED AI Photo Booth Workshop

## Welcome to the Node-RED AI Photo Booth Workshop

In this workshop, participants will learn how to use Node-RED to create a photo
booth web app infused with AI through the use of TensorFlow. The workshop will step
through getting started with Node-RED, creating the web app and then containerising
it, ready to be deployed into the cloud or onto edge devices.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires:

 - A laptop/computer with a Web Cam attached
 - Node.js 12.x or 14.x
 - Git

## Navigation

To move through the workshop you can use the side panels to select a specific
section or use the navigation links at the bottom of each page to move to the
next or previous section as required.

## Access to workshop material

The source for this workshop is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/knolleary/node-red-workshop-photobooth/)
and this site is automatically generated from it. The repository also contains
examples and other content that can be used through the workshop. You may want
to clone the repository to your local computer so you have them readily available.

## Workshop Outline

### [1 - Introduction](part1/)

Provides an overview of the course, introduces the technologies that will be used
and demonstrates the end result of the application the workshop will teach you to create.

### [2 - Node-RED](part2/)

The second part of the workshop introduces Node-RED - the low-code programming
tool for event-driven applications. It will help you:
 - get Node-RED running on your local computer
 - enable the Projects feature
 - create a simple application to learn how Node-RED works
 - learn how to install additional nodes into its palette

If you are already familiar with Node-RED, you can skip this part.

### [3 - Node-RED Dashboard](part3/)

In this part you will install the Node-RED Dashboard set of nodes and learn how
to quickly create a simple photo booth application using them.

### [4 - TensorFlow in Node-RED](part4/)

This part brings TensorFlow into Node-RED. It will look at some of the different
nodes for TensorFlow that are available from the community and compares their
capabilities.

You will then integrate the TensorFlow nodes into your photo booth application.

### [5 - Creating a container](part5/)

In this part, you will add a Dockerfile to your Node-RED project that can be used
to create a containerised version of your application.

### [6 - Summary and next steps](part6/)

Finally, we'll review what you have covered in this workshop and highlight a number
of areas where the application you've created could be expanded as a follow-on
activity.
