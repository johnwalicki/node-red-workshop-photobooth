                The Cloud-Native Toolkit is an open-source collection of assets
                that enable application development and support teams to deliver business value
                quickly using Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud-managed Kubernetes.
                This guide provides information to help Developers, Administrators,
                and Site Reliability Engineers use the Toolkit to support delivering business
                applications through the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

                The Cloud-Native Toolkit environment has been built to support the principles
                of a robust SDLC while being flexible enough to fit into a wide range of
                development settings and toolchains. The Cloud-Native Toolkit supports different
                tool selections, from open source versions of tools like Artifactory and SonarQube to
                enterprise-class software like IBM Cloud Pak for Applications and IBM Multicloud Manager.
